aquametNWCA
===========

The goal of aquametNWCA is to calculate vegetation metrics and the Vegetation Multimetric Index (VMMI) for EPA's National Wetlands Condition Assessment (NWCA). The calculations of metrics and VMMI scores are based on the 2011 survey. Calculations are currently based on use of the taxa lists as utilized for the NWCA 2011 report. This includes taxonomic information, Coefficients of Conservatism, native status, and Wetland Indicator Status as assigned in 2011. Detailed information on expected fields in input data frames is provided in help files for functions, and examples of how to use functions together are provided in vignettes as part of the package documentation. In addition, there are PDF files containing metric descriptions for each set of metrics calculated.
