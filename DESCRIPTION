Description: This package calculates metrics and
    indices associated with NWCA 2011, including
    vegetation, buffer, and hydrology metrics,
    using field data and trait information for
    vegetation. Functions for vegetation are broken
    into vascular plants, trees, and vegetation types
    and ground cover. Updated from version 1 by adding
    increased flexibility in inputs to functions.
